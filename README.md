This is an app to pratice my skills that I gained at Enspiral Dev Academy's Bootcamp and a surprise for my girlfriend. She is an artist across many mediums and as an artist it's great to have an archive of all of your work. 

## Wireframes

To pratice using Bootstrap and Figma I have made some Wireframes for the MVP. I'd like the site to be responsive so you're able to use it on a phone or on desktop.
